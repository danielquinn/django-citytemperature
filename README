This database took a Very Long Time to compile, so I thought that I'd share
it.  django-citytemp is a collection of cities and their local temperature
data conveniently packaged into a Django app.

If you're not using Django, the data should still be accessible.  Everything
you need is in the `sql/` directory.  `_structure.sql` has the table
definitions, and the other two sql files have the data.
